# voluntary_music_metadata_enrichment

## Summary

A Ruby on Rails engine which adds a music model with discography sync through http://MusicBrainz.org, http://last.fm plus http://Spotify.com to every Ruby on Rails application. But it does not import everything: see [Which data will be imported?](https://github.com/volontariat/voluntary_music_metadata_enrichment/wiki/Which-data-will-be-imported).

You can create year in reviews for music albums and songs, read more about it here: http://www.last.fm/user/MurdochFFM/journal/2015/02/19/6fmfpm_top_songs_2014_created_with_open_source_website_volontari.at
