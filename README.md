# voluntary_music_metadata_enrichment

## Summary

A Ruby on Rails engine which adds a music model with discography sync through http://MusicBrainz.org, http://last.fm plus http://Spotify.com to every Ruby on Rails application. But it does not import everything: see [Which data will be imported?](https://github.com/volontariat/voluntary_music_metadata_enrichment/wiki/Which-data-will-be-imported%3F).

You can create year in reviews for music albums and songs, read more about it in my blog post @ http://last.fm: [Top Songs 2014 created with Open Source Website Volontari.at](http://www.last.fm/user/Volontarian/journal/2015/03/12/6grdr2_top_songs_2014_created_with_open_source_website_volontari.at)

Furthermore you can manage last.fm groups with artist connections voting, release announcements and music video indexing.
